# xLaDe Roadmap

xLaDe is an experimental ecosystem for Lean 4, aiming to enhance theorem verification and provide a modern platform for collaboration, AI integration, and improved usability.The roadmap and planned direction for the project is as following:

## Current Status

- Forked Lean 4 core is available in the repository (`leancore`).  
- Basic project structure is established.  
- LICENSE (Apache 2.0) and CONTRIBUTING guidelines are in place.  
- Community contributions are welcome.

## Short-Term Goals

1. **Humanized Proofs**: Make proof scripts more readable and understandable by humans.  
2. **Tactics Improvement**: Enhance existing Lean tactics for better automation and usability.  
3. **Error Understanding and Correction**: Provide informative feedback and guidance for fixing errors in proofs.  
4. **Creating an IDE**: Develop a basic Integrated Development Environment for Lean 4 users.

## Medium-Term Goals

5. **Visual Input in Lean**: Enable graphical or visual inputs for theorem representation.  
6. **Machine Learning and AI Integration**: Introduce experimental AI/ML modules to assist in theorem proving.  
7. **Inbuilt Community Features**: Create tools for communication, discussion, and collaboration within the ecosystem.  
8. **Lean on Mobile and Other Devices**: Adapt Lean to run efficiently on mobile devices and lightweight platforms.

## Long-Term Goals

9. **Integration with Other Proof Assistants**: Enable interoperability with other theorem provers and formal verification tools.  
10. **Lean Language Improvements**: Propose and implement enhancements to Lean 4’s language and core features to improve expressiveness, usability, and performance.

## Notes

- The roadmap is **flexible**, and priorities may evolve as the project grows.  
- Community feedback is highly encouraged to help shape the future of xLaDe.
