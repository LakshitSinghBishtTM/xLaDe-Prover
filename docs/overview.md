# xLaDe Overview

**xLaDe** is an experimental ecosystem for Lean 4, designed to explore new directions in theorem verification, human-friendly proofs, AI-assisted reasoning, and community-driven development. This repository currently serves as a conceptual framework to guide contributors, researchers, and students in shaping the ecosystem.

---

## Project Vision

xLaDe aims to create a modern, flexible, and extensible Lean 4 ecosystem that empowers users to:

- Write **human-readable proofs** and leverage improved tactics  
- Understand errors and receive **guidance for corrections**  
- Develop or use an **experimental IDE** tailored for Lean 4  
- Add **visual representations** of theorems and proofs  
- Integrate **AI and machine learning** to assist theorem proving  
- Provide an **inbuilt community** for communication and help  
- Run Lean on **mobile and lightweight devices**  
- Enable **interoperability** with other proof assistants  
- Improve **Lean language features** for usability and performance  

---

## Current Status

This project is in the **early conceptual stage**. The repository includes:

- `leancore/` – forked Lean 4 core  
- `gitmodule/` – modular setup for future extensions  
- Documentation, roadmap, and contributing guidelines to guide early contributors  

While no major code developments have been added yet, the structure is designed to support experimentation, contributions, and collaboration.

## Getting Involved

Even in its early stage, contributors can participate by:

- Suggesting improvements via GitHub issues  
- Proposing additions or modifications through pull requests  
- Engaging in discussions about tactics, AI integration, IDE ideas, and other conceptual features  

For detailed contribution guidelines, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

The xLaDe roadmap outlines **short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives** for the ecosystem. Key highlights include:

- **Short-Term:** Humanized proofs, tactics improvement, error understanding, IDE foundation  
- **Medium-Term:** Visual input support, AI/ML integration, community tools, mobile adaptation  
- **Long-Term:** Interoperability with other proof assistants, language-level improvements  

See [`ROADMAP.md`](../docs/ROADMAP.md) for full details.
