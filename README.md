**xLaDe** is an experimental ecosystem for Lean 4, designed to explore new directions in theorem verification, human-friendly proofs, AI-assisted reasoning, and community-driven development.

This project is currently in an **early conceptual stage**. The repository includes a forked Lean 4 core (`leancore`) and modular setup (`gitmodule`) to provide a foundation for future development. While the codebase is minimal at the moment, the structure, documentation, and roadmap are designed to guide contributors and collaborators in shaping the ecosystem.

## Vision

xLaDe aims to create a modern, flexible, and extensible Lean 4 ecosystem that empowers researchers, students, and developers to:

- Write **human-readable proofs** and leverage improved tactics  
- Understand errors and receive **guidance for corrections**  
- Develop or use an **experimental IDE** tailored for Lean 4  
- Add **visual representations** of theorems and proofs  
- Integrate **AI and machine learning** to assist theorem proving  
- Provide an **inbuilt community** for communication and help  
- Run Lean on **mobile and lightweight devices**  
- Enable **interoperability** with other proof assistants  
- Improve **Lean language features** for usability and performance  

---

## Roadmap Highlights

The project goals are structured across **short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives**. Key highlights include:

- **Short-Term**: Humanized proofs, tactics improvement, error understanding, and IDE foundation  
- **Medium-Term**: Visual input support, AI/ML integration, community tools, mobile adaptation  
- **Long-Term**: Interoperability with other proof assistants and language-level improvements  

For a detailed roadmap, see [`roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).
